# Anomaly Detection in Smart Grids Using Blockchain-Integrated Collaborative Decision-Making Systems  

## Project Overview  
This project presents a decentralized system for detecting anomalies in smart grids. It integrates blockchain technology for secure, collaborative decision-making, ensuring tamper-proof validation. The primary objective is to improve anomaly detection accuracy and enhance the security of smart grids by combining machine learning with blockchain consensus mechanisms.

###  Features  
- Decentralized Anomaly Detection: Utilizes 10 distinct machine learning models (LSTM, CNN, Autoencoder, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, MLP, RNN, TCN, Logistic Regression) to detect unusual patterns in smart grid data.  
- Blockchain Integration: Uses Proof of Authority (PoA) for decentralized consensus, enabling secure and tamper-proof anomaly validation.  
- Tamper-Proof Validation: Anomalies detected by ML models are verified using blockchain voting, and the results are stored immutably.  
- Efficient Processing: Utilizes LSTM and CNN for accurate temporal and spatial anomaly identification.  
- Hybrid System Architecture: Integrates ML-based detection with blockchain for secure decision-making and auditability.
